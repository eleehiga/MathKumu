# MathKumu
Math Tutoring app.

Modules in this repository:
- main.py, python file used to run the backend
- MathKumu and MathKumu.IOS folders, contains Xamarin app code
- MathKumu.ipynb, Jupyter Notebook file used to train the neural network that identifies mathematical symbols

What I used to make this app:
- Flask, making the API
- Postman, testing the API
- Tensorflow, Machine learning for optical character recognition
- open-cv, computer vision for parsing individual symbols
- python, programming language
- xamarin, in c# which I used to make my front end
